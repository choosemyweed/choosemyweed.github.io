## A high five to the face!

Hits hard, spanks ya a bit and leaves NO taxi fare.

### Trust her .. but only a little bit

Headcheese is an amazing strain produced exclusively by Emerald Evolution.
A hint of Cheese and a whole lot of Headband make this one of the most known 
"heavy hitter" hybrid strains in Northwest Washington.

## It'll blow your mind
