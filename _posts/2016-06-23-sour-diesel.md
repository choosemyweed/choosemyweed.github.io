### Beware of zombie leaves

Life Garden's never been known for the best trim job, 
and this batch of Sour Diesel is no exception.

Overall bud quality continues to improve and the flavor is less "harsh" than experienced in previous batches.

#### Be picky .. just pick the un-flattering leaves off

Don't fuss over the look of this bud.
It's worth loading a couple bowls when you got a chore list to complete.

## A "classic" high
