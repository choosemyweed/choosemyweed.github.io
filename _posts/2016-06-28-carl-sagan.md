#### Decent -but- expected more.

This strain is decent but Western Washington producers grow indica strains with a more potent effect.
No hard feelings towards a great producer like Fruit of the Root, just don't get your hopes too high.
Next years batch could always be better, or the harvest just needs a little aging.

### Still very pretty little buds.

### Everything is made from star stuff!

Even Carl Sagan ...

That pipe you rip huge bowls, or your triple-perk dab rig, all are made of star stuff.
