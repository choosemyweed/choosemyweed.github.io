### Everything is made from star stuff!

Even Carl Sagan!

Even the pipe you rip huge bowls, or your triple-perk dab rig, all are made of star stuff.

#### Decent ....

This strain is decent but Western Washington produces better indica strains than this.
No hard feelings towards a great producer like Fruit of the Root, but wait for this one to go on sale.
Next year may be a better batch.
