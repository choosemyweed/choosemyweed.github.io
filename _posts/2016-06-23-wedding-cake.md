### Worth trying atleast once

Just passing through? Come here often?

Either way, you can't beat this sweet treat. 
Wedding Cake is a superior strain from Gateway Organix (previously Upper Skagit Ventures).
Smell .. taste .. it's all there with this one. 
This weed stands out and is only more proof to the dominance of Northwest grown marijuana.
As described, just like cake.

## It's freakin' Wedding Cake!
