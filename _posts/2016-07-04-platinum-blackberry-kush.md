## Leafy .. it's a good thing

'Leafy' is not a bad term here, it just a simple way to express the bud structure. 
Leafy marijuana like Blackberry Kush is usually fluffy with a medium to heavy coating of frosty crystals.

### Dont pass it up

The one downside, this amazing marijuana is hidden behind a package. 
Just look at it again.
