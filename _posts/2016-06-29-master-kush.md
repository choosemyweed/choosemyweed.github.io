farm-desc: 'Obey your master...or suffer the wrath of this classic strain. 
            Master Kush is a superb balance of full-body relaxation without the mind-numbing effect many indica stains produce.
            It offers a sharpened sensory awareness that can bring out the best of any activity. Recommended for: video games and headphone music'

Hard too see the details, but the trim job is decent.
