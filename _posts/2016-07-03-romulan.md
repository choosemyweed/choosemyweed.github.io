### Can't get over the leaves.

Such frosty leaves, could have been trimmed a little better. 
Usually a low quality trim job is alright, as long as the bud guality is decent. 
This is no exception, very strong high effect and the length of the high was average.

#### Two large buds

Can't complain about getting two healthy sized buds in the 1 gram bag. 
As usual, northwest grown has not let down.

### Burns a bit fast

Maybe not this fast .. you get the point.
